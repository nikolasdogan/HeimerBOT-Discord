# Standalone Binary

Download binaries from the [Download Server](https://repo.lavalink.dev/artifacts/lavalink/), [GitHub releases](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases) (specific versions prior to `v3.5` can be found in the [CI Server](https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1))
or [GitHub actions](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/actions).

Put an `application.yml` file in your working directory. ([Example here](index.md#example-applicationyml))

Run with `java -jar Lavalink.jar` from the same directory
